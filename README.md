# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This is a **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) Sentiment Analysis project, where I meticulously explored movie review data to understand and categorize sentiments. I conducted a rigorous **preprocessing** phase, employing techniques like sentence and word tokenization, stopword removal, HTML tag and special character elimination, lowercase transformation, and word normalization.

In pursuit of optimal sentiment classification, I extensively tested various **text vectorization methods**, including Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF. The project involved an in-depth analysis of different **supervised machine learning models** such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLPClassifier). Utilizing GridSearch and Stratified K-Fold for parameter tuning and validation, I successfully identified the best parameters for each model.

The outcome was exceptional, achieving an **accuracy of 89.33%, F1 score of 89.59%, precision of 91.44%, and recall of 87.81%**. These results surpass the baseline, underscoring the effectiveness of the project in accurately categorizing movie reviews.
